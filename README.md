# sigsci-sounds
Listen to the soothing sounds of attacks and anomalies.

### Description

The [Signal Sciences] (https://signalsciences.com) web protection platform offers a rich API that enables limitless integrations and automation. Or, at lease only limited by your imagination. As an example of this, sigsci-sounds is a utility to audibility monitor when Signal Sciences detects attack or anomaly events against your web site. You literally can listen to your site being attacked.

The utility is configurable so you can define which attacks or anomalies you want to hear.

Note: obviously you must be a Signal Sciences customer to make use of this utility.

### Requirements

- Golang support
- OS X (currenlty, sigsci-sounds was built & tested on OS X, and uses default commands and sound files found on OS X)
- A Signal Sciences API account.
